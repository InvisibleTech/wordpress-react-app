# wordpress-react-app
A simple Typescript based React App using WordPress REST Api for data.

Based on these sources:

* https://developer.wordpress.org/rest-api/reference/

* https://blog.usejournal.com/react-wordpress-rest-api-c6e94595e4d7

No tests, it is kind of messy since it is a POC.  But it gets the text data.  Images need work.
